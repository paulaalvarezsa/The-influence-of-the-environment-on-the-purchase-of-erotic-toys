## Hypothesis
**Are sales** of erotic toys influenced by the price of **barrel of oil** and/or the **position of the moon**?

It is conceivable that in the adult toy shop, the environment influences purchasing decisions, being a product that is not a staple, and that mood could be a driver of purchase.

It could be thought that in adult toys, the environment influences purchasing decisions, being a product that is not a basic necessity and that the mood could be the driving force behind the purchase. 2022 has been a year marked by economic instability in which countries such as the UK and Spain, which were not used to it, have experienced inflation, and their citizens have lost purchasing power.


The price of **barrel of oil** has been rising daily. Has this influenced the decision to buy erotic toys?

Could the **position of the moon** have influenced the days that adults have decided to invest in their erotic life by buying toys?

## Conclusions

A correlation can be seen between the rise and fall of the barrel price and the turnover in the second half of the year.

The phases of the moon do not seem to influence sales, while if they do, the phase that has coincided most with the rise in turnover is the new moon.
